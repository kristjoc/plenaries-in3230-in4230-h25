# UNIX sockets

In this example, we will implement a client/server application that
communicates through UNIX sockets. In the Oblig and Home Exams, UNIX
sockets will serve as the interface between the MIP daemon and higher
layers, such as the ping applications.

## Usage

- Compile the program using `make all` in the main directory.
- `./chat -s` to run the server and `./chat -c` to connect as a client.
- Follow the on-screen instructions.
- Practise and implement new features.
