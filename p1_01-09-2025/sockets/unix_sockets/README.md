# 2nd Plenary (IN3230/IN4230) - UNIX sockets

During this session, we're going to implement a client/server application that
talk to each other through UNIX sockets. In the Home Exams, UNIX sockets will
function as an interface between the MIP daemon and upper layers, such as ping
applications.

## Usage

- Compile the program using `make all` in the main directory.
- `./chat -s` to run the server and `./chat -c` to connect as a client.
- Follow the on-screen instructions.
- Practise and implement new features.

All the best! :-)
